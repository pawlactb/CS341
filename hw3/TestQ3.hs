search takes the following parameters
  1. A function to check if the search is done
    - this function takes:
      a. the global information for the problem
      b. the partial solution
    - the function returns a bool indicating if solution is complete
  2. A function to find the valid next states to go to
    - this function takes:
      a. the global information for the problem
      b. a partial solution
    - the funtion returns a list of valid next states
  3. Global information for the problem
  4. A partial solution
    - a partial solution is a list of states in reverse
search returns a list of all full solutions reachable from
  the partial solution
    - full solutions will be in forward order
